# Malware Detection using GRU and LSTM

Detecting app that contain malware and preventing to make harm mobile device.



## Problem

As technology improves number of application(apps) being increase. Securing user data is very import. However, there are some apps, which are harmful and exploits the user data.


## Dataset

Android malware dataset are categories into two type based on permission given to service of app.
1. Permission based 
2. Non Permission based

Here, permission based dataset are used for detection of app contains malware.

Sample example of service need by app
Transact,	onServiceConnected,	attachInterface,	android.os.Binder,	SEND_SMS,	Ljava.lang.Class.getCanonicalName,	URLDecoder,	android.content.pm.Signature,	android.telephony.SmsManager,	READ_PHONE_STATE


## Model 
We use two model for efficiently detecting the malware.
1. LSTM
2. GRU
